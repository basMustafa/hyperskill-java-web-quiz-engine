# Web-quiz-engine

In the Internet, you can often find sites where you need to answer some questions. 
It can be educational sites, sites with psychological tests, job search services, or just entertaining sites like web quests. 
The common thing for them is the ability to answer questions (or quizzes) and then see some results.
In this project, i developed a multi-users web service for creating and solving quizzes.
